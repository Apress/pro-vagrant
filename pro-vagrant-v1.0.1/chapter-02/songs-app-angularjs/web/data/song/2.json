    "content": "Sing a song of sixpence,\nA pocket full of rye;\nFour and twenty blackbirds\nBaked in a pie.\nWhen the pie was opened,\nThey all began to sing.\nNow, wasn't that a dainty dish\nTo set before the King?\n\nThe King was in his countinghouse,\nCounting out his money;\nThe Queen was in the parlor\nEating bread and honey.\nThe maid was in the garden,\nHanging out the clothes.\nAlong there came a big black bird\nAnd snipped off her nose!"
